Demo checklist

- Add a short screen recording (MP4 or WebM) of the app running on an Android device or emulator.
- The video should show: navigating the app, adding/editing a visitor, creating a concert and purchasing a ticket, and opening the About page.
- Place the video file here (e.g. `demo/demo-recording.mp4`).
- Add `app-debug.apk` to the repo (in `demo/` or repo root). The APK must be a debug build that installs standalone.

Notes for the demo recorder:
- Use an Android emulator (AVD) or physical device.
- Recorder tools: scrcpy + ffmpeg or use Android Studio's screen recorder.
